- update MPA data for all EU overseas territories
- analysis of network characteristcis of MPAs (using similar methodology as in Wood et al Oryx paper); do this for regions, including OS territories only and then including non-OS territories countries that are included in the broad region

We have been asked by Marc Metzger at Edinburgh University to join a consortium bid for a EC Framework 7 call for proposals. Marc is sending an outline in coming days and there will be a planning meeting late August in Brussels. Details of the EU call as follows:
 
 
 
ENV.2012.6.2-1 Exploration of the operational potential of the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capital to systematically inform sustainable land, water and urban management 
Ecosystem services and natural capital are increasingly put forward as key conceptual approaches to improve land-use management and develop innovative public goods and sustainable economic activities. This requires a better understanding of (i) the potential of the ecosystem services and natural capital approach and (ii) how best to operationalise these concepts within key regulatory frameworks. Integrated natural, social and economic research is needed to assess the ecosystem services relevant to human well-being, and analyse links between and comparisons across locales, sectors, scales and time (for example, across a network of coherent case studies) in a range of social-ecological systems, including fresh water bodies and rural and urban areas. Focusing on the biological/physical control of ecosystem services, research will examine the effects of multiple drivers, structural factors (including biodiversity), and human feedbacks on ecosystem services. Such research is to (i) provide a better understanding of how drivers and management, including the green infrastructure approach, change ecosystem services, and (ii) explore, demonstrate and validate mechanisms, instruments and best practices that will serve to maintain and enhance a sustainable flow of a broad range of services from ecosystems while preserving their ecological value and biological diversity. Focusing on the socio-economic implications of choices on the use of ecosystem services, research will address the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and between components of social and individual well-being that arise from the demands on these systems. Such research is to (iii) qualify and quantify these trade-offs and synergies and link them to the respective stakeholders across locales, sectors, scales and time, (iv) identify the potential for the development of innovative and sustainable processes derived from ecosystem services, and (v) explore, demonstrate and validate instruments and practices that will serve to align disconnected and conflicting interests and take power asymmetries into account in balancing trade-offs in social and individual well-being. In both biological/physical and socio-economic dimensions, work will (vi) develop methods and coherent and shared protocols to provide consistent and integrated datasets and knowledge (vii) and explore and where possible implement ways to ensure the perennity of any key data base, decision support system or other major product of the research. Integrating these strands of investigation, research is to provide plural and conditional alternatives for operationalising the concept of ecosystem services and natural capital to support the formulation and implementation of regulatory frameworks such as the Water Framework Directive, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Green Infrastructure approach, the Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment and Environmental Impact Assessments.","UNEP-WCMC Ecosystem Assessment"

This will involve: further development and refinement of the reporting sheets for MFSD Articles 8, 9 and 10 that are currently under development; consideration of existing data reported under the MSFD; potential synergies with other Directives and regional and international Conventions; and the development of reporting summaries to compare, aggregate, summarise and visualise the information and data that will be held in WISE-Marine. 
The project has three main components according to these requirements:
• Initiation of the development of ‘output content’ from the data and information reported by Member States under the MSFD in 2012;
• Review of links between MSFD reporting requirements and reporting under other EU Directives (e.g. Habitats and Birds Directives, Water Framework Directive) and international agreements such as the Regional Sea Conventions (RSCs);
• Refinement of reporting sheets for Articles 8, 9 and 10, and development of reporting sheets for Article 11 (Monitoring requirements).
The project will involve close interaction with the European Commission (EC), European Environment Agency (EEA), Member States and the Working Group on Data, Information and Knowledge Exchange (WG DIKE) to ensure that developments are in line with Commission, EEA and Member State requirements. The project will take place over one year, potentially renewable for a further year.
MRAG Ltd, in association with URS Scott-Wilson and UNEP-WCMC, are currently developing the reporting sheets for Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the MSFD and are well placed to continue this work and provide the further inputs and analysis required to assess links with other directives and agreements, and develop output content for WISE-Marine.

UNEP-WCMC's role is spread across all work packages, to support the science policy interface aspects of the project. It also has more substantial time allocated to working on socio-economics and governance issues related to the deep sea, including the use of criteria to identify potential areas for protection / increased management (e.g. FAO's criteria to identify Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems & the CBD's criteria to identify Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas on the open ocean and deep seas).","UNEP-WCMC Marine Assessment & Decision Support"

The Reporting Sheets to be developed under this project are the conceptual models for specific reporting needs; they will specify what information needs to be reported, why it must be reported, and how it should be reported, detailing information requirements, formats, reporting frequencies and deadlines. Specifically, these Reporting Sheets will be developed for the reporting requirements under the MSFD that are due in 2012. 
 
 
Improving and streamlining the flow of data and information is important to help avoid duplication and reduce the burden of reporting on Member States. The MSFD information will be reported through WISE-Marine, the marine part of the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). The development of WISE-Marine is one step in the process of expanding WISE to incorporate various types of information.
 
 
 
The project will take place over one year and will progressively develop sets of Reporting Sheets for a selection of marine strategy elements due to be prepared in 2012 under the MSFD. The development of the Reporting Sheets will be based on a review of previously-developed Reporting Sheets for the Water Framework Directive (WFD), with which they will need to ensure coherence and compatibility. Their development will be carried out through an iterative process between the consultants and relevant institutions and Member States, in particular DG Environment and the Working Group on Data, Information and Knowledge Exchange (WG-DIKE). 
 
 
This process will be part of and will support the agreed Common Implementation Strategy for the MSFD, endorsed by the Marine Directors in May 2009. ","UNEP-WCMC Marine Assessment & Decision Support"

Under this agreement, UNEP-WCMC shall a) calculate statistics on the protected area coverage of the world’s terrestrial and marine ecological regions based on the 2011 version of the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and b) prepare and publish the 2011 Protected Planet Report. The preparation and publication of the report will be co-funded by UNEP and the Finnish Government. The report will be launched at the CBD SBSTTA 15 meeting in Montreal and will measure progress made towards the CBD protected area targets.","UNEP-WCMC Protected Areas"
"06114.00.E","Fitzgerald, Claire","Mangroves W Africa REDD+","External","This is a project through UNEP.
 
The Government of the Republic of Congo approached the United Nations Environment Programme in order to seek assistance in protecting the mangrove areas of  western central Africa (Gabon, Republic of Congo & DRC), as well as explorting the feasibility of setting up a REDD+ project for mangroves in the region. 
The objective is to conduct a study of the economic values of ecosystem services of the mangroves of the western central Africa region (encompassing Gabon, the Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo) in order to inform the REDD+ processes in these countries and to make the case for the inclusion of mangrove forests in REDD+. The report should target the governments of the western central Africa area as well as the UNFCCC COP-17 in Durban in November/December 2011.
 
 
 
UNEP-WCMC's role would be to: 
1. improve baseline mangrove data through validation of the mangrove atlas data and possibly also an earlier time snapshot of data from Chandra Giri; 
2. develop baseline maps and statistics by country and a report on threats and pressures (at the country level) to mangroves. 
3. Possible third activity (TBD) would be to compile a spatial layer of C storage and sequestration indicators based on data collected by project partners. Gabriel Grimsditch is enquiring with UNREDD about the feasibility of adding this to the project.
